-RoundRobin (acts as the scheduler that the distributor uses)
-Fix shortest job first algorithm (can take the current thing for round robin)
-Fix PIDs (seem to get really big, so aren't incrementing properly and are reusing PIDs)
-Fix memory issue in dispatcher for deleting processes
-fix rand not working for randomizing created processes (currently crashes the running thread, maybe cause it has multiple processes in the pNeedsSorting?)

-Fix that currently the use of a number rather than a pointer for a thread slot causes the array to only get bigger (might be okay if no change of threads is wanted)

-Make the program more user friendly (better start screen and a help command)

-Fix memory count (is being added incorrectly when totaled)

-Might need to fix the parent being able to die before the child

-Can simulate another cpu by having something else that manages schedulers

-Can implement force killing a process by emptying its events (use empty() function on event queue)

-Critical sections can bug out if forking is done during one (can increase cap by having two exit critical section when only one entered)
