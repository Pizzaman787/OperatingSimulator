Have a header script that is the name of the script/class but ends in .h
It should have the declarations, meaning it should include the class, but no functions or constructors (or most of the inclusions)
Include the header files in any file that needs access to the class
In the main file, include the cpp files (they shouldn't have the parts in the header files, aka the class declarations and stuff) after the header files
This should give the compiler the definitions while also preventing weird duplicate definements
