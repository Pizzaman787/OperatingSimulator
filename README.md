# OperatingSimulator
A project for CMSC 312

This is a project to create a program that "simulates" the running and management of processes like an operating system would.

Current Notes:
-Critical section only supports one thing in it at a time
-Semaphores, including the critical section, use busy waiting
-Created in C++ (Only properly tested on linux systems (Ubuntu 20.04LTS))
